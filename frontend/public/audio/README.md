# Kazkar Ambient Audio Placeholder

This file serves as a placeholder for the ambient audio file that should be placed here.

## Required File
`kazkar_ambient.mp3` - Ambient background music for Kazkar legends

## Specifications
- **Format**: MP3 (or OGG for better web performance)
- **Duration**: 2-5 minutes (will loop)
- **Mood**: Dark, mysterious, atmospheric
- **Volume**: Mixed at moderate level (users can adjust)
- **Size**: Keep under 5MB for fast loading

## Suggested Characteristics
- Deep bass tones
- Subtle synthesizer pads
- Minimal percussion
- Ethereal textures
- Slow tempo (60-80 BPM)

## Attribution
If using royalty-free music, ensure proper attribution is included in the application credits.

## Implementation
The audio file is loaded in `LegendScene.tsx` and plays automatically when a legend is viewed. Users can control volume and playback via the audio controls.

## Temporary Solution
Until a proper ambient audio file is provided, the system will gracefully handle the missing file and continue functioning without audio.
